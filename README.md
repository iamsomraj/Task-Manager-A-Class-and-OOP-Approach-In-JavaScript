# Task Manager A Class and OOP Approach In JavaScript
Task Manager A Class and OOP Approach In JavaScript is a repository where there are basically 2 types of project lists. Interaction between them is done in an class based approach. This is by far the most challenging project that I have worked on. It took me several hours to understand callbacks and everything rest.
